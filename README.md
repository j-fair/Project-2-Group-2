## CryptoPunk Interest - Data Visualization


For our project, our group is interested in current technology trends, specifically NFTs, which stands for non-fungible tokens. With NFTs being a relatively new trend, we narrowed our focus to a popular collectible NFT that has been around for a few years and has an established market, CryptoPunks.

CryptoPunks are a collectible digital image that is popular on internet forums and trading.

Our final design will be a website that allows the user to select the CrytpoPunk ID from a drop down menu, then displays the image attributes of the CryptoPunk along with sales trends over time for the selected CryptoPunk. Possibilties of expansion (time dependent) would be a filtering query to list the CryptoPunk IDs that meet the search criteria.

The target audience for our website would be those individuals who are interested in purchasing CryptoPunks and want to visually see the data represented in an easy to read format using data visualization tools. Right now on the LarvaLabs website, the data is listed in list format, and gets cluttered with bids & offers, while we are only interested in sales data.
